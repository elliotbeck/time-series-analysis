# Time-Series-Analysis

This repository serves as official code source for the course Time Series Analysis ([03SM22MO0166](https://studentservices.uzh.ch/uzh/anonym/vvz/?sap-language=DE&sap-ui-language=DE#/details/2022/004/SM/51144599/50000003/Wirtschaftswissenschaftliche%2520Fakult%25C3%25A4t/50609459/Master%2520of%2520Science%2520UZH%2520in%2520Wirtschaftswissenschaften%2520(C%252C%2520PVO13)/51106318/Volkswirtschaftslehre%2520(Fast%2520Track)), SS 23) at the University of Zurich, Department of Economics. All code is written in R. I borrow most of the code from other sources (below). If you find any bugs or typos, please [open an an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) and I will try to take care of it asap. Or even better, fork the repo and [submit a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

## Note

I include some data in this repo, which is not good practice in general. I try to make up for it by using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com), which replaces large files such as audio samples, videos, datasets, and graphics with text pointers inside Git, while storing the file contents on a remote server.

## Sources

This course heavily borrows from [Michael Wolf](https://www.econ.uzh.ch/en/people/faculty/wolf.html)'s course Time Series Analysis and his former TA Marc Sommer.
